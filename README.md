# Orbis Libris

First website ever made by me, in 2021, for pubilsing books reviews and articles about literature and philosophy in Spanish.

First version of the website was made with Wordpress and Elementor. Then I made a complete remake with Next.js and SASS. This was the fist time I've used Next.js with Page Router.
